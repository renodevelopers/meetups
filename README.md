# Reno Developers Meetup

Hi, and welcome to /dev/reno. We are excited to see you at our monthly meetup.  

We want our group to be an open and safe place for programmers of all ages, experience levels, genders, preferred programming languages, and backgrounds. The only way we can do that is if you join us and help us grow. If you have any questions please feel free to ask [here](http://meetup.com/dev-reno) or contact me directly (don [at] elskwid [dot] net).

We're always looking for talks and topics to appeal to a wide range of experience levels. Please consider giving a short talk sometime. [I know you'll be great](https://github.com/renodevelopers/meetups/issues?state=open)!.

## About /dev/reno

Part talks, part sharing, part support group. /dev/reno is an environment where new and experienced programmers come to meet other developers and learn about new technologies as well as time-tested patterns for getting the job done.

Are you a programmer living or working in the Reno area? Have a talk we'd love to hear? Have a harrowing experience related to a programming language or environment? Just want to have a listen? 

Come spend an hour or two with us every month. We would love to meet you!

### Organization

We schedule the meetups and social stuff at [meetup.com/dev-reno](http://www.meetup.com/dev-reno/) and we use this repository to handle the [details of scheduling talks](https://github.com/renodevelopers/meetups/issues) and [other minutia](https://github.com/renodevelopers/meetups/wiki). 

Meeting dates are normally the last Monday of the month and start at 6:00pm at the Reno Collective. Use the links below to see the agenda of upcoming and past meetings.
